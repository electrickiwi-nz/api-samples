# Electric Kiwi API Samples

### Getting started

The samples within this repository provide the ability for you to start developing a widget using one of the following programming languages:

* [Javascript](https://github.com/electrickiwi-nz/api-samples/tree/master/javascript)
* [Node](https://github.com/electrickiwi-nz/api-samples/tree/master/node)
* [PHP](https://github.com/electrickiwi-nz/api-samples/tree/master/php)
* [Python](https://github.com/electrickiwi-nz/api-samples/tree/master/python)

Within each sample there are steps to follow specific to the language which will allow you to login and make an endpoint call. 

You will need to register at [https://developer.electrickiwi.co.nz](https://developer.electrickiwi.co.nz) to get client_id (`YOUR_CLIENT_ID`) and client_secret (`YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`) which will allow you to configure the samples, log in to the sandbox environment, and query the Electric Kiwi API. 

Please refer to the specific sample programming language README.md for further instructions to get you started.

Happy coding!
